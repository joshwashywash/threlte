type: 'hook'

A hook that can be used to give a scene an asciiEffect. It is essentially a wrapper around the `AsciiEffect` addon from three/addons that hooks into some of threlte's context for ease of use.

<Example path="extras/use-ascii-effect" />

## Usage

```ts
const { render } = useAsciiEffect()

// render with the main scene and main camera (what you would get out of useThrelte())
render()
```

The render function may take an optional object that allows you to use the effect with a different scene or a different camera.

```ts
const camera = new PespectiveCamera()
const scene = new Scene()

// render the main scene using `camera`
render({ camera })

// render `scene` with the main camera
render({ scene })

// render `scene` with `camera`
render({
  camera,
  scene
})
```

Both oft these arguments are optional and fallback to the main threlte camera andor the main threlte scene.

## Context

`useAsciiEffect` creates a context with the `render` function and the `current` instance. You can extract these by using `useAsciiEffectContext`

```html
<!-- In a child of a parent that has called `useAsciiEffect` -->

<script>
  const { current, render } = useAsciiEffectContext()
</script>
```

## Parameters

`useAsciiEffect` accepts an object of getters to various parameters. These parameters are detailed below.

| name               | description                                                                                                              |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| getRenderer        | returns the renderer to use. used in the derived AsciiEffect's constructor                                               |
| getCharSet         | returns the characters to use. used in the derived AsciiEffect's constructor. should be sorted by ascending "opaqueness" |
| getOptions         | returns the `AsciiEffectOptions` to use. used in the derived AsciiEffect's constructor                                   |
| getForegroundColor | returns the color to use for the characters. may be any valid CSS color string                                           |
| getBackgroundColor | returns the color to use for effect's dom element background. may be any valid CSS color string                          |

These are all getters because they are read in `$effects` and `$derived`s in the body of `useAsciiRenderer` function.

### Options

The AsciiEffect addon doesn't support modifying props after creation. For this reason a new AsciiEffect instance is derived any time an options prop updates. Each options prop is detailed below.

| name       | description                                                                                                            |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| alpha      | whether to consider alpha when determinging the color of the character. if your scene uses alpha, set this to true     |
| color      | whether to use the "true" color of the scene. may slow down performance especially at higher resolutions               |
| block      | whether to use color blocks when `options.color` is set to true                                                        |
| invert     | uses the more "opaque" characters for darker parts of the scene. brighter parts get mapped to less "opaque" characters |
| resolution | more or less detail in the render                                                                                      |
| scale      | scales the characters. isn't effected by any camera properties                                                         |

```ts
// use block coloring and an inverted character set
useAsciiEffect({
	getOptions: () => {
		color: true,
		invert: true
	}
})
```
